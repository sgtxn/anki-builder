For the Finnish word/phrase: "%s"

Please provide a JSON response with the following structure:
{
  "phrase": "the original Finnish word/phrase in dictionary form, lowercase",
  "translations": ["translation1", "translation2", ...],
  "examples": [
    "Example sentence 1 in Finnish",
    "Example sentence 2 in Finnish",
    "Example sentence 3 in Finnish",
    "Example sentence 4 in Finnish"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "synonyms: abc, def... (include puhekieli/informal variants if applicable)", 
    "etymology: brief origin info for loanwords which would help with remembering the word (so skip proto-Germanic/proto-Finnic origins)", 
    "extra: grammatical information, usage quirks, and any other useful information for language learners"
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- If the word I provided is not in nominative (dictionary) form - use the dictionary form when writing examples and notes
- Provide all relevant translations (most common meanings)
- Create 3-4 example sentences at B1-B2 level, try to include examples for different translations of the word/phrase
- Try to use the word/phrase in different grammatical cases in different example sentences (if applicable)
- Make examples natural and contextually rich
- Use the word in different grammatical cases/forms when possible
- For etymology, synonyms, grammatical notes, and usage tips in the notes section - don't add obvious information, keep it concise
- Use lowercase for notes
- Keep the prefixes of the notes consistent (e.g. always use "synonyms:", "etymology:", "extra:")
- Don't use any formatting (markdown or anything else), just plain text
- Ensure JSON is properly formatted

Respond ONLY with the JSON, no additional text.
