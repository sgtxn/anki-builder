- Make examples natural and contextually rich
- Use the word in different grammatical cases/forms when possible
- Include etymology, synonyms, grammatical notes, and usage tips in the notes section, but don't add obvious information - keep it concise.
- Use lowercase for notes
- Make sure to add puhekieli versions of the word to synonyms if applicable
- Try not to skip etymology if available
- Keep the prefixes of the notes consistent (e.g. always use "synonyms:", "etymology:", "extra:")
